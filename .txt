Super Mega Monster

This card's health is 1000.

When casted,
	add this card to the casters's board.

When turn started,

		this card's fear increases by 1,
	
	if this card's fear is greater than 4,
		deal 100 damage to the opponent
		this card's fear is now 0.

When used,
	choose a monster in the opponent's board,
		deal 50 damage to monster,
		monster's wear inceases by 1
		if monster's wear is divisible 3,
			deal 50 damage to monster



This is a card format for a procedural card game. The idea is that cards will be source code which is interpreted and ran, automating effects and values.

Most of the "syntax" of the language is just natural language syntax. However we can parse through it like so.

A card is procedurally ran top to bottom as object oreiented (equall ecs style also is possible):


const SuperMegaMonster(game, caster, opponent) => {
    const this = {};

    this.health = 1000;

    this.casted = () => {caster.board.add(this);}

    this.turnStarted = () => {
        if (caster.board.has(this)) 
            this.fear = (this.fear || 0) + 1;

        if ((this.fear || 0) > 4){
            deal(100, opponent);
            this.fear = 0;
        }
    }

    this.used = async () => {
        const monster = await opponent.board.choose()
        deal(50, monster);
        monster.wear = (monster.wear || 0) + 1
        if(monster.wear % 3 === 0)
            deal(50, monster);
    }
}

Here casted, turnStarted, and used, are built into the game and are triggered via loop or ui. For example, casted is what is called when the card is in the hand and is played, used is called when the user clicks on the card on their turn, and turnStarted runs everytime the casters turn starts,


One thing I want to note is that I'm not exactly sure how I want to parse multi word tokens. For example, if I wanted to reference the name of the card in the text I suppose I would have to use "string literals".

For example we have "turn started", this is triggered in the game engine so it wouldn't be of problem, but if a card is something like

When used,
    choose a monster in the caster's board that has "calls rain",
        monster calls rain
