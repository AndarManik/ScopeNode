# **Scope Node**

**Scope Node** is a multiplayer top-down aimbot shooter, where movement and positioning are the only controls.

Combat takes place in an arena of randomized obstacles. After every round, the losing team chooses where the next obstacle is placed.

At the center of the map is an **Orb** which instantly kills the enemy team when touched.

If the round has not finished after 30 seconds, the **Orb** will expand until the team closest to the center wins.
